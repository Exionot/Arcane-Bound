Arcaena and synthspire are parallel realities, they have *some* similarities but also differences, any big historical event occur in parallel. In example:
### **In Arcaena**
- A goblin invasion 
### **In Synthspire**
- A bot invasion 
So whatever happens in one reality also happens in the other. **But** not everything in these realities are parallel. In comparison:
### **In Lenben Village, Arcaena**
- A small village near Bauserst City that specializes in brewery and healing magic.
### **In Fluxpoint City, SynthSpire**
- A dense metropolitan area known for its advancements in electronics.
It's not completely similar that one is the opposite of the other but, it's not completely different that there's nothing in common. If one experiences war the other goes to war too.


> [!question] Why is it important to point this out?
> Because both realities are the same geographically, same continent, same mountains, same bodies of water, the only things that are different are the locations and the people living in those locations.
>
> It's like having two books where one is sci-fi themed and the other is medieval fantasy themed, similar plot points but different worlds.
