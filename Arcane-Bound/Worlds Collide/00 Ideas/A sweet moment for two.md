This could be one of the partners but it's gonna be used for mint and aura (i feel it).

This could be placed after a big climax/event/catastrophe where they hang out together and its around sunset time then it goes something like:

*Mint is against the railing or whatever and aura is standing a little bit behind her*
*The both of them look at the sunset, internalizing what they have gone through together*
M: Sunsets are always beautiful no matter where you are, huh..
A: It really is.
*Mint turns around facing Aura with an accomplished smile, the light of the sunset hits half of her face, giving her a soft orange glow*
M: It really makes me happy that I met you.
*Aura, lost for words, blushes as she hears these words from Mint*
M: Hey! You're blushing!! So cute!!!
A: You can't just say things like that and not expect me to be surprised!!
M: Aww, we're my words too charming Miss tough girl? *>:3*

Then it just transition to them goofing or just cut it at that. Then in other moments when Aura's alone, maybe she gets flashbacks of this then blush just rethinking that moment.
