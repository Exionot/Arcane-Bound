# Who gets added?
Highest in priority are *the girls*:
- [x] *The* og OC (it's ion, but still subject to change)
- [x] [[Mint Evergreen]] (literally favoritism wth)
- [x] [[Aura Brillfer]] (of course they're both the first ones)
- [x] Vi (Vi? Vivi? Idk, to be decided )

Scrapped characters probably? (Design overhaul needed):
- [x] The traveling merchant (Age of Elementals)
- [x] The red haired girl with the headband (Rem. No not *that* Rem)
- [x] The pink hair girl with the gradient hair color
- [x] The teal demon girl that was replaced by vi (her name was haruka/teal apparently)
- The white haired ace mage (Age of Elementals)
- The cherry miku clone (the og design of the pink hair girl but they're different now i guess)
- S-chan (Symmetry girl)
- Grayscale twins
- [x] Black and red girl (literally "unnamed oc 3.png")
- The *the* mascot 

OG designs of OCs (idk how I would put that in the story)

Character ideas floating in my head:
- Houshou Marine clone (Age of Elementals)
- Frieren clone (Age of Elementals)
- El Fail inspired character (Ttop)
- The traveling merchant's assassin (Age of Elementals)

# How can they fit in?
## Ion
- Most likely from [[Synthspire]], the clothes looks to modern (unless I use the wizard design)

## Vi
- Handles something fancy in [[Synthspire]]
- She was originally designed to be like a fancy/rich character (Miles Edgeworth/Ryo Yamada type character)
- Vixen-humanoid
## Traveling Merchant (Age of Elementals)
- A traveling merchant from [[Arcaena|Arcaena]]
- He's a big gray bear
- Knows alot about [[Arcaena|Arcaena]]
