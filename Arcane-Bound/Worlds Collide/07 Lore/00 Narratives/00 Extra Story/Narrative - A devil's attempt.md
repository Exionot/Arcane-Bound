*Clair sits in the lobby of Starveil Retrieval waiting for service.*

**Clair:** *Ugh... This headache is killing me, I hope this isn't **her** doing...*

**Rem:** Welcome to Starveil Retrieval Services! What can we retrieve for you?
**Clair:** I would like to look for this boo- Ack!

*Whispers forcibly fills Clair's mind. Unbearable pain surges through her head, both hands on her ears as she drops to the floor.*

**Rem:** Miss! Are you alright?!

*Rem rushes to Clair, bringing her to the lobby chairs.*

*Clair raises her head, her eyes lights up with an eerie glow.*

**Clair:** How about we have some fun in this new world?~

*Clair pushes Rem away and casts a binding spell. Silk-like threads wrap around Rem's hands and legs, immobilizing her.*

**Rem:** Who are you and what do you want with us?!
**Clair:** I wonder if anyone in this building would even notice if you disappeared. Isn't it weird that for a city so populated, to have a place so barren and empty?

*As Clair taunts Rem, a fist lightly presses on her back*

**Vi:** Don't even attempt turning your back, you'll be gone before you can even blink.
**Clair:** Heh. Alright, fine. I concede.

*Clair collapses on the floor, the binding on Rem disappears. Vi and Rem are both left confused.*
