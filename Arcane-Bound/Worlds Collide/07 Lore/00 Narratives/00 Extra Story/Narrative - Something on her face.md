*Mint and Aura are in the living room couch, they just finished eating a frosted cake.*

**Mint:** Sweets in this world are the best!
**Aura:** I guess your world has not quite figured out sweets yet.

*Aura looks at Mint, her smile gives Aura a warm feeling. While looking at Mint, Aura notices a small bit of frosting left in Mint's face.*

**Aura:** You still have frosting on your face. 

*Aura wipes off the frosting on Mint's cheek, she gazes into her face, her hand lingers longer than it should. Aura gets caught by Mint's smile.*

**Mint:** What's the matter?

*Aura blinks, snapping out of it, she pulls her hand off of Mint's face.*

**Aura:** Ah, sorry, I got distracted...
**Aura:** *What was that all about? I should be figuring out how this girl got here.*

*Mint smugly looks at Aura.*

**Mint:** Were you distracted by my cuteness?~

*Mint tries to tease Aura by acting cute.*

**Aura:** No. Let's clean up, we need to figure out how you got here.
**Mint:** Aww...
