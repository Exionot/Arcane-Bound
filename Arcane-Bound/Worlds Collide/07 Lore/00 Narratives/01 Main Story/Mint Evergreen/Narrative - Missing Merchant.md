*Mint is tending to her plants until suddenly a familiar voice shouts her name. Mint turns around and sees Ion Kynne, one of her friends from the Wandering Traders of Arcaena. *

**Ion:** You're a master of Flora Magic why are you growing you plants that way?

**Mint:** I got it in Bauserst City, I was told it was fragile to magic. Plus, it's fun to watch it grow slowly.

**Ion:** Sounds like a bad plant to me.

**Mint:** Hey! It's an plant from one of the ancient civilizations. What brings you back here anyway? I thought you guys were going up north to Aquarin?

**Ion:** Well, that was the plan, until Ted decided he wanted more of your Phthalo Roots and went back while we were in Ignia. It's been 5 days since he strayed from the group so we went here to look for him.

**Mint:** Ted? He hasn't come by here since your last visit. Maybe he got lost on the way back?

**Ion:** That's impossible, that bear is as ancient as bricks, he practically knows every path in Arcaena.

**Mint:** Could it be he got captured by the people that attacked you last time?

**Ion:** That seems to be the case... Would you help us find him?

**Mint:** I would like to but the village is going to celebrate the Crops Festival in a few days, so I can't really go wandering around the kingdom.

**Ion:** That's unfortunate... Well, we'll be staying in Rhilekos City while we look for him, so if you were to cross paths with Ted, please bring him there.

**Mint:** Alright! 

*Ion and her group left after their conversation with Mint*
