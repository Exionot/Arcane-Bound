*Aura locks the door to her apartment.*

**Aura:** Tell me, what does your group want with Synthspire?
**Mint:** Group?...
**Aura:** There have been multiple cases of missing people in the entire continent and coincidentally there have also been reports of people appearing with absolutely no records even in the biggest database in the world.

*Mint, shocked, the realization finally settles in that she had been transported to another world.* 

**Mint:** I... I don't know... 
**Mint:** I was just enjoying the snow in our village and then suddenly... I was here... I got transported into a completely different world...

*Aura, unconvinced, she points her wrist weapon at Mint.*

**Aura:** Stop playing with me feline! What do your people need with the people of Synthspire!?

*Mint backs off, summoning her staff and pointing it at Aura.*

**Mint:** I have no idea of what you are talking about miss! I just want to get back home!

*Aura, bewildered, seeing a long staff suddenly appearing from thin air. Shocked, she fires an electrocuting dart in an attempt of immobilizing Mint.*

*Mint dodges the dart, she casts a sharp gust of wind towards Aura. It pushes Aura back scratching her cheek.*

*Aura touches her cheek, a thin streak of blood traces from the scratch to her fingers.*

**Aura:** Where did you get this tech?
**Mint:** "Tech"? You mean my spell?
**Aura:** Stop making a fool of me feline! I know you are using weaponized projection technology!
**Mint:** I am not! I don't even know what those words mean! 
**Mint:** Let me show you.

*Mint approaches Aura and conceals her staff.*

*Aura repels away from Mint's hand.*

**Mint:** Stay still.

*Mint places her hand on Aura's wounded cheek.* 

*Mint casts a healing spell, a bright green light emits from Mint's hand, healing the scratch on Aura's face.*

*Mint grabs the mirror on the counter, showing Aura her face. The scratch has healed.*

**Mint:** Do you believe me now?
**Aura:** H-how is this possible...
