**Mint:** Where are we?
**Aura:** This is where I live. 
**Mint:** Oh, I thought you were just going to tell me how to get out of this city.
**Aura:** The city is way to big to get to any exit gates by foot, and it gets really cold during the night, don't you want a place to pass the night? Your clothes look roughed up too.

*Aura opens the door to her apartment, it is completely different to what Mint is used to, almost completely alien to her.*

**Mint:** Whoa... this is nothing like the inns I've been to. 
**Mint:** *Looks like she the only person here, I can only smell her scent in the entire room.*
**Aura:** *"Inns"? is this girl from the first civilization?*

*Mint lies on the couch, completely amazed by it's softness.*

**Aura:** It's just a couch, have you not tried one before?
**Mint:** This is the softest couch I've ever sat on! Not even the King's couch can beat this one!
**Aura:** *"King"?? She either from the first civilization or she's trying to throw me off. I need to get to the bottom of this before something bad starts.*
