*Aura leads Mint into a building complex instead of the streets.*

**Mint:** Where are we going?
**Aura:** We're going to where I live.
**Mint:** Oh, I thought you were just going to tell me how to get out of the city.
**Aura:** The city is way to big to get to any exit gates by foot, and it gets really cold during winter nights, don't you want a place to pass the night? Your clothes look roughed up too.

*Aura opens the door to her apartment, it is completely different to what Mint is used to, almost completely alien to her, walls are not made from wood and stone and lights emit from the ceiling instead of lamps and candles.*

**Mint:** Whoa... this is nothing like the inns I've been to. 
**Mint:** *Looks like she the only person here, I can only smell her scent in the entire room.*
**Aura:** *"Inns"? What is she talking about? Is this girl from the first civilization?*

*Mint lies on the couch, she sinks a tiny bit, the mattress' softness engulfs her entire body. She is completely amazed by it's softness.*

**Aura:** It's just a couch, have you not tried one before?
**Mint:** This is the softest couch I've ever been on! Not even the King's couch can beat this one!
**Aura:** *"King"?? She either from the first civilization or she's intentionally distracting me. I need to get to the bottom of this before she and command notices.*
