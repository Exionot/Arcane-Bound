*It's the first day of winter, tiny snowflakes falls from the sky covering the lush green grass of Lenben Village with a thin layer of white snow.*

*Mint roams around the village watching as the snow falls. Mint turns around. The village has disappeared, in its place is a dark alleyway of a city. Despite travelling the entirety of the Verdthorne Kingdom, she does not recognize this place, the architecture is almost alien to her. Confused, Mint exits the alleyway only to see a bustling city before her.*

**Mint:** *How did I end up here? I was at Lenben just a moment ago. Teleportation magic? No, there's no such thing in Arcaena. Illusion Magic? But I don't sense any mana anywhere, in fact, I don't feel mana anywhere...*

*Mint closes her eyes and focuses, she exerts a small amount of mana hoping to disturb any stagnant mana lingering around her but the only thing she detects is radio silence, almost as if mana did not exists.*

**Mint:** Where am I...
