*Mint finds herself in what it seems like the center of a bustling city, the area is loud, people walk by at every moment, their outfits are more diverse, almost casual yet different to arcaenian outfits.*

**Mint:** I really need to find a way to get out of here...

*Mint remains lost, she looks in between the crowd and sees it. Ears and tail just like hers, a fellow feline is within her sight. Mint squeezes against the crowd catching up to the feline she saw.*

**Mint:** E-excuse me!

*Aura stops walking and turns around. She sees a green haired feline-humanoid, her clothes differs from anything she has seen before.*

*Aura's bodyguards raises their weapon and aims it towards Mint.*

**Bodyguard:** Back off civilian!

*Mint steps back and before she could summon her weapon, Aura commands her bodyguards to lower their weapons.*

*Mint focuses and checks aura for any traces of mana, but to no avail, there's nothing.*

**Aura:** Are you in need of any assistance?

*Mint being too focused, unknowingly misses Aura's question and stares at her awkwardly.*

**Aura:** Are you lost?

*Mint returns back to her senses.*

**Mint:** Ah! Yes, it seems like I got suddenly transported here. 
**Mint:** Where are we right now?
**Aura:** This is Amphere Square of Fluxpoint City.
**Mint:** I didn't know Arcaena had such developed cities like this.

**Aura:** *"Arcaena"? Is she one of those people who seemingly appeared out of nowhere? I've been hearing classified reports from Shatterpoint city of similar cases to this...*

*Aura commands her bodyguards to return to base. The bodyguards walk away, leaving Aura with Mint.*

**Aura:** Follow me.

*Mint, confused, nods and follows Aura.*

**Mint:** *She might have answers to what's happening so I can get home.*
