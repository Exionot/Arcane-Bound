**Mint:** I really need to find a way to get out of here.

*Mint, lost, looks around the area and spots someone of the same species. She ran towards the fellow feline, going against the flow of the crowded path.*

**Mint:** E-excuse me!

*Aura stops walking and turns around. She sees a green haired feline-humanoid, her clothes look ancient, almost out of this world.*

*Aura's bodyguards aim their weapon towards Mint.*

**Bodyguard:** Back off civilian!

*Mint steps back, Aura commands her bodyguard to lower their weapons.*

**Aura:** What do you need?
**Mint:** Where am I?
**Aura:** You are in Amphere Square of Fluxpoint City, are you lost?
**Mint:** I was suddenly transported here... I didn't know Arcaena had such developed cities.

**Aura:** *"Arcaena"? Is this she of those people who seemingly appeared out of nowhere? I've been hearing reports from Shatterpoint city of similar cases to this.*
**Aura:** Return to base, do not report this to the other responders, I'll handle this myself.
**Bodyguard:** Roger!

*The bodyguards walk away, leaving Aura with Mint.*

**Aura:** Follow me.

*Mint, confused, nods and follows Aura.*

**Mint:** *She might have answers to what's happening so I can get home.*
