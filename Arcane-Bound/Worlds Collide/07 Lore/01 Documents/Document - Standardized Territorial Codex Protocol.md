# **Basic Information**
**Name**: Standardized Territorial Codex Protocol

**Type**: Standardized Naming Protocol

**Scope**: Continent–City Level *(Including orbital nations)*
**Status**: Active

# Overview
The **Standardized Territorial Codex Protocol** enables a unified sector-district naming system for all recognized continent, nations and cities within [[Terra]] and its orbital infrastructures. This protocol will ensure that no naming conflict can occur between continents, nations and cities, even orbital territories.

# Territorial Codex Format
Division on a continental scale will be assigned as **Sectors**, division on a national scale will be assigned as **Regions**, and division within a city will be assigned as **Districts**.

**Continental Sectors** are assigned with four character codes (`ABCD-XX`), **National Regions** are assigned with three character codes (`ABC-XX`) and **City Districts** are assigned with two character codes (`AB-XX`). Should the division be broken down into multiple sub-divisions, it will be assigned with an alphabet after it's assigned number (`ABC-XXA`).

**Format**: `[Area Code]-[Region/Sector/District Number]`
## Examples
- `STSP-04` -> Synthspire, Sector-04
- `HCR-05` -> HyperCorp Republic, Region-05
- `NTU-02A` -> NeoTech Union, Region-02A
- `NTU-02B` -> NeoTech Union, Region-02B
- `FP-01` -> Fluxpoint City, District-01
- `LS-08` -> Lightspeed City, District-08
